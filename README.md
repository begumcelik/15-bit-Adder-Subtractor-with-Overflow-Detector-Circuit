# 15-bit-Adder-Subtractor-with-Overflow-Detector-Circuit

The circuit that can both add and subtract two 15-bit integer and realize whether there is an overlow or not, have been designed and implemented with using Verilog HDL. Two different method were used while crating this circuit, and then  these two different adder-subtractors were compared in terms of propagation time and area requirements.These two adder-subtractors are as follows:

1.	15-bit carry-ripple adder-subtractor using full adders
2.	15-bit hybrid adder-subtractor using carry lookaheads 

This project have been implemented for an undergraduate course CS303-Logic & Digital System Design at Sabanci University
